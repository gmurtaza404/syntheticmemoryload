# syntheticmemoryload
Host a server to serve pages with different memory foot prints



To run the server install node, and just type node server.js on the terminal. That will spawn a process that will be hosting
a server listening on port 12000
To fetch a webpage, open browser and type localhost:12000/first_page.html to get the normal page with all the elements. 



The script makePages.py genereates a super set of all possible htmls from a given set of objects. The final files are stored in
the folder ./pages.
